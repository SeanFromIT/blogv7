# What I'm Up To Now
## Last updated: 26 September 2018

<section id="post" markdown="1">
**Boards and committees:**
* Sherburne County Economic Advisory Committee
* DFL State Central Committee Delegate
* CD6 DFL Director
* Sherburne County DFL Director
* DFL Precinct Chair (Big Lake City P3)

If your start-up or non-profit board needs an experienced Fortune 100 alum / tech MBA who is not afraid to speak his mind, please get in touch.
On the non-profit side, I generally spend my time with those addressing economic justice, seeking to reduce poverty and improve/fund public education.

**Professional Life:**
* Cloud Engineering Practice Director at the Nerdery, helping companies embrace cloud first and DevOps mentalities
* Mentoring others, helping them reach their goals - you can request career advice from me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanfromit)

**Personal Life:**
* Spending time with my three kids; being there for them at their extracurricular activities as much as I can
* Trying to fix up the house to get it ready to sell this spring
* Househunting south of the Twin Cities, since Ireland still isn't working out
* Occasionally responding to [Feeney Genealogy Project](http://feeneygenealogy.com) requests for help and updating my own tree

**Side Projects:**
* Keeping [Student Loan Bill Tracker](https://studentloanbilltracker.com) up to date and advocating for solutions, political and business, to the crisis
* I took this year off, but every other year or so I advise senior or junior projects for my undergraduate alma mater

**How I prioritize all this:**

In evaluating adding things to my life, I try to gauge its impact on:
1. My health and wellbeing
2. My family
3. Existing side projects and my career

Ideally it's something that I - and others - are passionate about and naturally improves the above.

**Things I want to do:**
* Relocate to Ireland
* Get out from under the indentured servitude of student loans
* Run for state office
* Learn to play guitar
* Visit the Johnson Space Center in Houston
* Visit Jungfrau Park and its inspirations like the pyramids of Egypt, Easter Island, Incan ruins at Cusco and Machu Picchu, Mayan ruins at Teotihuac√°n and Chichen Itza
* Fill in my National Parks Passport with places like Mesa Verde, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Arches
* Take the family camping & stargazing in a dark sky area
* Spend more time in Italy, maybe Rome
* More canoeing, maybe up at the boundary waters
* Caving / spelunking
* Vacation somewhere with warm, clear, blue water

Is there anything I can help you do? Get in touch.
