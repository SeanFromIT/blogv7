Until Cincinnati Bell / Q1 Wireless / Commtiva / whoever fixes the Market problems on the Blaze, here are downloadable versions of the missing apps that you can copy to your SD card and [install via "Apps Installer"](http://www.brighthub.com/mobile/google-android/articles/37151.aspx) (which is thankfully actually available via Android Market on the Blaze...lol):  
  
Key Ring: (com.froogloid.kring.google.zxing.client.android.apk) (Hyped by Cincinnati Bell, but unavailable via Blaze's Android Market!)
