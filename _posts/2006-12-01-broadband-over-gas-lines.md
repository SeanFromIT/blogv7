> [Corante](http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/2005/05/12/broadband_to_the_home_via_natural_gas_pipelines.php) and the [Red Ferret Journal](http://redferret.net/?p=5171) discuss one company's plans to offer 10Gbps Wireless transmission of ultra-wideband signals using existing gas pipelines. The company's [press release](http://www.nethercomm.com/headline2.htm) goes into only surface detail, but insists the idea requires no modding of the gas line. As specific as the company gets: Nethercomm "introduces signals into the gas lines using inexpensive equipment located at existing neighborhood network hubs and extracts data at the customer or business premises with end user-installed equipment."

The jokes are already pouring in:  
  
"Hum.. An idea with explosive potential...  
  
CUSTOMER: I am having problems getting a connection...  
TECH: Exactly what is the problem?  
  
CUSTOMER: I think the line is clogged?  
TECH: How can you tell?  
  
CUSTOMER: I unscrewed one of the gas line. Smells really bad. Give me a second. Sounds of a match being struck and burnning. A Boom then the line goes dead.  
TECH: Well it sounds like you have solved your problem... News at eleven!"  
  
"Gas line explodes! Thousands without Internet service!"  
  
"Oh.. I was wondering about this... the other day... I ate several LARGE helpings of beans....  
  
A few days later... flatulence... and being the kind of person not wanting to not use potential bandwidth... I shoved a pipe up my......@#$ and connected RJ45s to it... and Voila.... CONNECTION!!!!  
  
Woooo Wooooo.... "
