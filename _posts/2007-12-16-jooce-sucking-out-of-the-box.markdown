I received an invite to Jooce last night. I registered, and all of the fields went red and said "Registration failed." It did not tell me why it failed. And when I go to register again, it says my username already exists. If I try to login with that username, it once again tells me registration failed. Still, no explanation of why it failed.  
  
Comment with your personal Jooce experience. Is everyone having this much trouble just registering?
