If you run Battlefield 2 (BF2) you may find that you receive an O/S error when you try to join a server after installing Windows Vista. To fix this, go to the Compatibility tab and check "Run as Administrator". It happens because the default run-level in Vista doesn't give permission for a program to access certain protected files.
