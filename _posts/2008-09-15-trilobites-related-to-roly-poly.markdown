Off-topic post...  
  
When I was a kid and going through my fossil hunter stage, I always had the hypothesis that trilobites were distant ancestors of roly poly's. I've yet to find any paleontologists who agreed with this, but we know trilobites lived on through species like horseshoe crabs, so it's certainly not out of the question. What do you think?
