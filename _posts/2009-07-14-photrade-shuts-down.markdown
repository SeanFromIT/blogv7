It was announced today that Cincinnati-based photo sharing website Photrade has been acquired by MyPhotoAlbum.com/dotPhoto.com after losing its seed funding in 2008. Anyone who followed the company blog knew that very few employees stuck around after the funding dried up. Photrade tried doing something different by paying photographers for the use of their flickr-like uploads when used on blogs and other sites. The PHP-powered site employed protection in the form of custom watermarking, size limits, link find and block, and a patent-pending "ad block" (where ads were used to protect your photos off the site and at the same time makes you money) to prevent illegal use. MyPhotoAlbum.com is planning on integrating some of these features into their system.
