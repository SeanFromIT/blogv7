(IGN) -- Itzik Ben Bassat, Vice President of Business Development and International for Blizzard Entertainment, would be keen to see a new StarCraft before too long.  
  
On stage in London for the WoW expansion game launch, Bassat stated, "I'm a StarCraft player myself and I hope it's not a decade, and we launched StarCraft in 1998, before I'm standing here again, celebrating the next game in the series."   
  
This isn't the first time we've heard murmurings from within the Blizzard walls - last year, the Chief Operating Officer, Paul Sams dropped a few hints that things were cooking on the StarCraft 2 development front. Could we be looking at a possible 2008 release?
