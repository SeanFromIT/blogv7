Is it just me or is it time for NASA to do an overhaul of its employees (as well as its mission and purpose, but those have been well discussed by others previously)? First the diaper-sporting astro-lover and now this? It's clear that either hiring or employee review practices must be screwed up at our nation's space program.  
  
My suggestion? Start fresh, with some graduates from RHIT... :-D
