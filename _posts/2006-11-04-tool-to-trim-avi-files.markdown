Ever wanted to cut off the beginning or end of an AVI file, or cut it into multiple pieces (for episodic or web viewing)? Here's a nice freeware tool that will do just that.


<blockquote>SolveigMM AVI Trimmer is a useful tool to enable very fast trimming or cutting any parts of AVI file of any size without quality loss. The trimming process is much faster than a real time since the core trimming technology doesn't involve any decoding/encoding process.</blockquote>
