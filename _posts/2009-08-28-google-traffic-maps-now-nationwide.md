Move over [CinciNavigator](http://data.cincinnati.com/navigator/), [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) has expanded its real-time traffic coverage nationwide thanks to cell phones running [Google Maps with My Location](http://www.google.com/mobile/gmm/mylocation/index.html). When the Maps application is open, it will send anonymous data back to Google about how fast you're moving and then combine it with others in the area to create color codings for traffic backups. More info available on the [Official Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/bright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html).
