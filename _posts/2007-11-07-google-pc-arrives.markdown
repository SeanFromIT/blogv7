If all you're doing is browsing the web, the $198 gPC is for you. You can order it online at [walmart.com](http://www.walmart.com/) or drive to Indy: [7325 NORTH KEYSTONE AVE](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=7325+N+Keystone+Ave,+Indianapolis,+Marion,+Indiana+46240,+United+States&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&hl=en&cd=1&geocode=0,39.888492,-86.121905&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=23.875,57.630033&ll=39.88911,-86.121912&spn=0.006816,0.020084&z=16&om=1). Here is a [list of stores nationwide](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=puQw7Vu_wGJx3o13-fy20FA). You will need a monitor, but those run pretty cheap at Wal-mart too...
