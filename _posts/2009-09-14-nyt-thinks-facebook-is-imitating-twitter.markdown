The NYT ran an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/technology/internet/14facebook.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss) yesterday claiming that Facebook is adding "Twitter-like" features. I would argue the opposite: Facebook had micro-blogging first, the NYT just missed out on it since Facebook was restricted to the college crowd at the time. Facebook has always been about keeping your friends up to date.  
  
Tagging has been around for quite sometime on the blogs, it was a natural extension to add it to status updates. And once again, Facebook is doing it better than Twitter, using AJAX drop-down suggestions for these new @ tags.  
  
The new Facebook Lite site is reminiscent of the original Facebook, and appeals to people who don't like Facebook's new found robustness - like Zuckerberg himself. These updates have little to do with Twitter and more-so to do with customer demands for increased usability.
