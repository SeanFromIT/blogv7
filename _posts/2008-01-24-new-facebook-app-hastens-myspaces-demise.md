Are you tired of those MySpace friends that still haven't made the smart switch to Facebook? Now you can keep tabs on them from inside Facebook!   


<blockquote>Fuser lets you check your MySpace messages, comments and bulletins without leaving Facebook. You can even display your MySpace comments as a separate wall on your Facebook profile.</blockquote>

The company is also working on a method for you to comment back and send MySpace messages from inside of Facebook, no release date on those features yet.
