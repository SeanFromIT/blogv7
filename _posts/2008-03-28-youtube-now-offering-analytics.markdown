The [Google blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/insight-into-youtube-videos.html) has a post about the new analytical features of YouTube. These features are free and include "how often your videos are viewed in different geographic regions, as well as how popular they are relative to all videos in that market over a given period of time. You can also delve deeper into the lifecycle of your videos, like how long it takes for a video to become popular, and what happens to video views as popularity peaks."   
  
You can find these metrics by clicking under the "About this Video" button under My account > Videos, Favorites, Playlists > Manage my Videos.  
  
I wonder how this will affect the companies who are charging people for these very metrics? You'll likely see their business strategies shifting from a YouTube focus to the cross-site deployment and analytics on those other video sites.
