From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon):  
  


<blockquote>The creator of the original ASCII emoticons :-) and :-(, with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion, was Scott Fahlman; the text of his original proposal, posted to the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general board on 19 September 1982 (11:44), was considered lost for a long time. It was however recovered twenty years later by Jeff Baird, from old backup tapes.[7]  
  
`19-Sep-82 11:44    Scott E  Fahlman             :-)  
From: Scott E  Fahlman

:-)  
         
Read it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark  
things that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use  
         
:-(`</blockquote>
