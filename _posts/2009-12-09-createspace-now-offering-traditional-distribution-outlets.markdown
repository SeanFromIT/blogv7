**December 9, 2009** - After years of offering book sales only through their own site and the Amazon marketplace, Amazon subsidiary [CreateSpace](http://www.createspace.com/) has finally found a way to list their ISBNs for sale to libraries and brick-and-mortar bookstores. It is available immediately for any book upgraded to a "Pro" account. Lucky authors were able to upgrade to Pro accounts last year for free, although that promotion is no longer offered. Pro accounts offer other useful features like reduced author purchase prices. This move puts CreateSpace toe-to-toe with traditional publishers, and even other print-on-demand (POD) publishers like Ingram's [Lightning Source](http://www.lightningsource.com/), who already offered such a service for a much steeper fee. At the time of this post, CreateSpace Pro plans costs $39 up-front and $5/year per book while Lightning Source costs $199 up-front.
