The Cincinnati/NKY metro ranked 12th in the nation for tech job growth between 2007 and 2008, according to a [new report](http://bestcities.milkeninstitute.org/bestcities2009.taf?rankyear=2009&type=state&state=OH) by the Milken Institute. Overall, however, the tech industry is less concentrated here than the US average, leaving us ranked 95th (out of the top 200 US metros). Much of this could be due to our region's lack of focus on overcoming interstate boundaries when attracting, nurturing and retaining high tech businesses.
