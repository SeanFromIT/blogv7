After upgrading to the latest version of Hamachi, I kept receiving this error: "Mediation server has rejected your login request." I ran through the solutions on the Hamachi site and none of them worked. Here's what did:  


  1. Close Hamachi.
  2. Disable Windows Firewall (Through Your Control Panel).
  3. Rename Hamachi Folder in %APPDATA%
  4. Open Hamachi.
  5. Create new account, DO NOT use the same username as last time.
