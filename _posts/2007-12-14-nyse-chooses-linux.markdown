An article in the New York Times today exposed that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has chosen Linux over Unix for its new Hybrid Market trading system where the x86 servers involved will be processing hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.  
  


<blockquote>Rubinow said that Linux is mature enough to meet his needs. The open-source operating system may not have all the polish of Unix technologies with 20-plus years of history behind them, "but it's polished enough for us," he said.</blockquote>

  
  
This is a major victory for Linux and the Open Source community.
