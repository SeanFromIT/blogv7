All I can say is wow. Within minutes this exploit will max out your $5000 iTunes PayPal agreement even though you did not touch the iTunes store - all you have to do is open the latest version of iTunes. This is a warning to everyone out there to immediately cancel your iTunes Billing Agreement on the PayPal website! More reason not to use iTunes I guess...
