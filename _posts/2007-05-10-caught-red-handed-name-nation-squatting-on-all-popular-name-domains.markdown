NameNation.com, a Wild West Domains reseller, has purchased several .name domains in order to profit off of the people and families who would likely use the recently released TLD, thus eliminating the benefit of the TLD entirely.  
  
This practice is common, and is in very bad taste. Most [law suits against squatters](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/14/1214254) are successful, and you do have [other options](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/302139_schreter02.html). But I call on everyone to petition Wild West Domains and their owner, Go Daddy, to step up and be a leader in fighting this "bad faith" use of domains.
