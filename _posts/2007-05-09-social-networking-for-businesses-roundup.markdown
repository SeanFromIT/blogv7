I posted earlier today about BusinessWeek's "[Avoiding the MySpace Mistake](http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/may2007/sb20070508_239968.htm?chan=smallbiz_smallbiz+index+page_top+stories)" article. Here are some additional articles from around the web relating to getting your business into the red-hot social networking scene:
