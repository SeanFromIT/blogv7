The FeedBurner Support Forum has a nice [topic](http://forums.feedburner.com/viewtopic.php?t=3377) on how to change that little icon in the Firefox URL box to point to your FeedBurner feed instead of your normal Blogger feed. Covers changing it in both versions of Blogger. Note: If you're using the new Blogger but with templates, you should change the meta line as listed in the "Old" Blogger thread but to the code mentioned in the "New" Blogger thread.
