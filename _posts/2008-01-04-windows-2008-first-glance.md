Here's my short analysis. The following are based on RC1. Features may change between now and R1.  
  
Windows Server 2008 Key New Features  
  


  * BitLocker Drive Encryption
  

  * Integrated Multipath I/O
  

  * IIS Health, Diagnostics, Performance Tools
  

  * Remote Differential Compression - Replicate files/directories over a WAN more efficiently (Better than rsync)
  

  * Server Roles - Streamlines server management by defining what a server is used for (ex: Web Server). Can download additional roles from MS by clicking "Check for New Roles."
  

  * Remote Server Administration Tools (Roles and Features Only)
  

  * Storage Manager for SANs
  

  * Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications - Basically gives you the ability to run Unix apps in a Windows environment. You'll need to recompile, but shouldn't need to change the code much.
  

  * Windows PowerShell (New, more robust scripting language)
  

  * Windows Server Backup
  

  * Windows System Resource Manager (Limit/prioritize CPU/Memory access at the service level)
  
  
Notes  
  


  * VMWare tools installs fine from VI Client. Network card drivers won't show up until you install VMWare tools.
  

  * I'm aware some of these features were available in previous versions, but now they're brought to the front of the show.
