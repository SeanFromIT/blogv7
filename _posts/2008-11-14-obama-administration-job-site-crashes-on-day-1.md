The many people who signed up on [change.gov](http://www.change.gov/) to receive an email when a full job application (to be a part of Obama's "non-career" administration) was available have apparently crashed the application system, which was launched late last night. Everyone who signed up received their email, but was greeted by a "No suitable nodes are available to serve your request" error message when attempting to access the website today. Perhaps some of those new jobs should be in the website QA department?
