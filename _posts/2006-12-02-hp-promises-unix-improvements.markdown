<blockquote>Hewlett-Packard is preparing to release security and virtualization improvements to its Unix operating system and says it's now fulfilling a long-promised Itanium performance advantage.  
  
Most of the improvements will arrive in HP-UX 11i version 3, due to begin shipping this year but not formally launched until about three months from now, said Nick van der Zweep, director of virtualization and Integrity server software. However, one security feature--the ability to automatically encrypt files as they're stored--already has been added to version 2. </blockquote>

  
  
OoO. When can we see such hacks for the Linux OS? (If you know of any already out there, feel free to comment on this post!)
