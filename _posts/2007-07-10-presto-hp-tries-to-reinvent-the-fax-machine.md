HP is now sponsoring an email-to-fax service called Presto and marketing it to people with elderly relatives who don't wish to use a computer. All you do is buy a printer and take it to their house and plug it into their electric and phone lines. No extra phone line needed. Will it catch on? I guess they only have a few years to find out! Make sure your grandma has plenty of paper...
