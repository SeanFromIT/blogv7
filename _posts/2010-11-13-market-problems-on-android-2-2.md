For some reason I got a download stuck, where it would crash the Market if I tried canceling it. The solution was to go to Market->Downloads and hold down on the download and select cancel from there, instead of going into the download details and pressing cancel there.  
  
After this, I was receiving Download Unsuccessful on anything I tried downloading. Formatting the SD card via the Android Settings menu was the solution.
