The speculation is finally confirmed...gamers everywhere got a collective woody today as Blizzard announced their latest project, Starcraft II. The announcement came after a week of the company teasing customers on their website with a timeline of their major projects with a big question mark in the 2007 slot.

For months the company has alluded to Stacraft II's development, but no one noticed that Blizzard purchased [www.stacraft2.com](http://www.starcraft2.com/) until recently. You can now find the cinematic and in-game trailers on that website.
