Many web developers are still not using web frameworks. Why? Probably because they're relatively new, so they probably haven't studied up on them yet.   
  
What is a web framework? It's a suite of tools already written in your language of choice that follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. The idea being, there are certain parts of web sites and applications that you often find yourself re-writing for each and every new project. By using a web framework, you can turn web development into an object-oriented process (so that you can follow a somewhat-normal software development process) and adhere to principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).  
  
Here is a current list of the top web frameworks:  
  


  * [Catalyst](http://catalyst.perl.org/) - The Perl web framework. Claim to fame: "No complicated object hierarchies" and you can use CPAN to grab the packages you need.
  * [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) - (Pronounced Zhango) The Python web framework. Claim to fame: Automatic admin interface for your site and you don't need to know any SQL.
  * [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) - The Ruby web framework. Claim to fame: "Convention over configuration" and most popular. Beware of the Pluralizer.
  * [Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) - The PHP web framework. Claim to fame: It's written in PHP, a language that most web developers are already familiar with.
