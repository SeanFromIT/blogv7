Problem:

<blockquote>When I install the "Import Contacts" plug-in from IE or Outlook browser, IE or Outlook crashes. A return to the page reveals that the plug-in was not installed. I am running Windows Vista with the latest version of IE and Outlook.</blockquote>

  
LinkedIn Customer Service Response:

<blockquote>Unfortunately we are not currently compatible with Vista or anything above IE 5 and Outlook is 6.1 Version.</blockquote>

  
Really? IE 5? I don't even think LinkedIn existed when IE 5 was the rage. Either this customer service person is ill-informed or LinkedIn doesn't want to offer support for their product.
