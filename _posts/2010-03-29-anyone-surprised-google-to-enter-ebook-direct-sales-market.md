Google announced to publishers today that in the "near future" they are launching "Google Editions," a paid access product that will enable you to sell digital books through Google Books and online retailers. The service encourages authors to set ebook prices at 80% of current print sales list prices, and hopes to partner with online retailers of print editions to bundle the Google ebooks with the print edition for 20% of the Google ebook price. The terms page suggests that Google is planning on using the epub format for these ebooks.  
  
[Ooka Booka](http://www.ookabooka.com/) is still my favorite ebook marketplace.
