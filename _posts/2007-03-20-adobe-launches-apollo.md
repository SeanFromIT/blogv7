New Technology Enables Web Developers to Extend RIAs to the Desktop  
  
SAN JOSE, Calif. (March 19, 2007) — Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: ADBE) today announced that the first public alpha version of Apollo is now available for developers on Adobe Labs. Apollo is the code name for a cross-operating system application runtime that allows web developers to leverage their existing skills in HTML, JavaScript and Ajax, as well as Adobe® Flash® and Adobe Flex™ software to build and deploy rich Internet applications (RIAs) on the desktop. Apollo combines the reach of Internet technologies with the richness of desktop applications, working seamlessly across operating systems and outside the browser to deliver a more consistent and engaging user experience. The alpha version of the Apollo application runtime and the Apollo Software Developer’s Kit (SDK) can be downloaded for free from [www.adobe.com/go/apollo](http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo).  
  
Apollo is an important element of Adobe’s strategy to provide technologies and product workflows for developers and designers to create and deliver new kinds of high-impact, rich applications, content and experiences to engage people virtually anywhere at anytime.  
  
“RIAs have become a core element of today’s web computing experience. We’re working to enable this new generation of innovative applications to bridge the chasm between the web and the personal computer. Apollo will empower millions of web developers to make their RIAs first-class citizens on the desktop using the tools they already know,” said Kevin Lynch, senior vice president and chief software architect at Adobe. “With this alpha release, we’re continuing our collaborative effort with the community of developers and designers to further evolve how the world engages with ideas and information. We can’t wait to see what the community will create in this new medium.”  
  
Apollo provides people with direct access to Internet applications (including those built with HTML, JavaScript, Flash and PDF) without the need to open a browser, offering a familiar desktop application experience, and easier and more reliable interaction with content. With Apollo, people can launch applications directly from their desktops and interact with them offline. When a network connection is available, newly created or changed content can seamlessly synchronize. In upcoming versions, Apollo’s integration with the desktop will allow people to drag and drop items, such as image files and other media assets, directly into Apollo applications.  
  
“eBay is constantly striving to provide the most compelling experience for our end users, and to enable eBay developers to do the same,” said Max Mancini, Senior Director of Disruptive Innovation, eBay. “Our work with Apollo is an example of one of the many ways eBay is delivering a fun, immersive experience outside of the browser. In this case, the eBay.com marketplace is brought straight to users’ desktops with improved caching, real-time product availability notifications, and auction updates.”  
  
The first version of Apollo for developers includes a free SDK that provides a set of command line tools for developing and working with Apollo applications. Web developers can use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of their choice, including Adobe tools such as Eclipse-based Flex Builder™, Flash, and Dreamweaver® software to build Apollo applications in significantly less time than it takes to build and deploy traditional desktop applications. Apollo complements Ajax and other RIA technologies. Additionally, upcoming versions of Apollo will integrate PDF, run on Linux, and include deeper Ajax support, and in the future Apollo will leverage mobile technologies.  
  
“Extending the web applications we’re developing to run directly on the desktop and across platforms, without extra coding or the need to learn new, complex OS-centric development technologies opens up new business opportunities,” said Michael Lebowitz, Co-Founder and CEO, Big Spaceship. “We can use our current skill set to solve some of the traditional problems that plague web applications, such as losing data when a page refreshes, and help our clients take the next step in connecting with their customers.”

The alpha version of the Apollo application runtime, required to run Apollo applications, and the Apollo SDK are available immediately as free downloads from Adobe Labs at www.adobe.com/go/apollo .
