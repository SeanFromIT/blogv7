1. Root your Note II.
2. Install BusyBox. JRummy's installer doesn't seem to work anymore, so I used Stericson's.
3. If you have WiFi Tether for Root Users already installed, uninstall it.
4. Install this modded version (WifiTether_TrevE_Mod_11_22_2012_driverReload2.apk) of it.
5. Open WiFi Tether, go into Settings, change the SSID, setup your encryption and you should be good to go!
