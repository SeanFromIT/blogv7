Ran across a shareware program called [JexePack](http://www.duckware.com/jexepack/index.html) today. It can convert Java programs you create into normal Windows EXE files so that your clients don't have to have all of the Java stuff installed. Snazzy. Adds a watermark to the end product though...$99 to buy.
