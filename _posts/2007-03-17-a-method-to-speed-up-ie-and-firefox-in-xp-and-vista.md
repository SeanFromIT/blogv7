Apparently, using RAMDISK (a program that creates a virtual hard drive using your RAM) you can speed up IE and Firefox. All you have to do is setup the drive and point your browser's temporary files to that drive. With as little as 70-80MB given up to the RAM disk, many users have reported dramatic speed boosts in browsing (even on dial-up).
