3 bed/2.5 bath/1,842 sqft/54 year old home in Cincinnati's College Hill Neighborhood going for $199k  
3 bed/4.0 bath/2,913 sqft/50 year old home in the same neighborhood for $296k  
3 bed/3.0 bath/2,200 sqft/54 year old home in Wyoming, OH for $340k  
3 bed/2.0 bath/1,515 sqft/55 year old home in Wyoming, OH for $195k
