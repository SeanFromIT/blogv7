Less than two years after purchasing SingShot, Electronic Arts has made the decision to close The Sims On Stage service in order to "focus resources on future games." The site will go offline on March 31, 2009.  This has to be good news for karaoke competitors like [SingSnap](http://www.singsnap.com/) and [SingStar Online](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fgw%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dsingstar%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=ufoundergroun-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) (online service currently only available via console), but what about users? What do you envision the future of online karaoke to be? SingStar is betting on the living room console, but I think the winner will be the first service to combine console and PC recording.
