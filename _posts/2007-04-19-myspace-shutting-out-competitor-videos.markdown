Today I was alerted that my account had been automatically detected as "phished". I know that it was not, and have a theory on why the automatic phishing detector was tripped:  
  
CAUTION: Using the "MySpace code" listed on any of the videos on ComedyCentral.com to try and post a comment to someone's profile on MySpace will result in an error and this phishing flag to be set on your account.  
  
This comes immediately after this week's [news](http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/commentary/listeningpost/2007/04/listeningpost_0416) that MySpace owner Murdoch decided that "MySpace is not the web" and does not have to allow Fox competitor videos anywhere on its site. Clearly everyone needs to migrate to a new social networking site that isn't filled with censorship. Suggestions, anyone?
