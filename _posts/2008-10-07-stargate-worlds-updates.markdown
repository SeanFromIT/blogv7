According to the developers, Stargate Worlds closed beta will "be up and running before the end of October." Specifically, the first day has been announced as Oct. 15th. No word on whether or not those chosen to participate will be notified ahead of time or not. The team has been releasing more game-play videos and character profiles as of late, so who knows, maybe it is ready for people to test?
