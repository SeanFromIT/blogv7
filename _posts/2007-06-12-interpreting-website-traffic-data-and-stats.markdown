From today's meebo blog:  


<blockquote>During the first year after meebo released we never knew what to expect on any given day of the year. Sometimes we’d be watching our stats graph and wonder “why on earth are we seeing a traffic spike now?” On the other hand, at other times, we’d wonder why there was this strange dip in traffic.  
  
It turns out you can see world events through meebo’s traffic, from students taking the SAT to Ascension day, celebrated through many countries world wide. Suggestion: check out www.earthcalendar.net. We’ve discovered that it’s a great place to turn in figuring out what’s happening around the world that may be causing a traffic irregularity.</blockquote>
