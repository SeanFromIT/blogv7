[Remy Sharp](http://www.remysharp.com/) wrote a nice little PHP script that grabs album art from your top 100 albums on last.fm. [Source](http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/topalbums.class.txt) and [example](http://boagworld.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=1662).  
  
I'm using it on my site now: it's generating the random cover art at the top right. Very slick and quick.
