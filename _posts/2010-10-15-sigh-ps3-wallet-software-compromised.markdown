I'm unable to find any information on whether or not saved cards in your Playstation Network Wallet are saved locally on the PS3 or on Playstation Network servers. Depending on where that's saved, either Playstation Network servers holding PCI-level account information have been compromised or the latest firmware update to the PS3 has been hacked. Either way, someone is now enjoying $150 worth of stolen digital copies of:  
  
NBA 2K10 PSP  
God of War(R) Chains of Olympus  
LocoRoco™ 2  
RIDGE RACER  
Monster Hunter Freedom Unite™  
Patapon™ 2  
THE KING OF FIGHTERS COLLECTION  
Killzone: Liberation  
Apache Overkill  
  
Like seriously? Digital games? You can't even resell those. At least if you set your hacking targets on iTunes you can funnel the money directly to your fake seller account. By hacking a PS3 Network account all you get are a few lousy games.
