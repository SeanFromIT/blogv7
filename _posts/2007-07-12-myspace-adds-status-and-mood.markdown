MySpace tonight unveiled it's new native "Status and Mood" update to better compete with sites allowing quick status updates like Facebook and Twitter. The status replaces the now common "XXX is in your extended network" box visible on each of your friend's pages. The mood fits neatly under your profile image.  
  
Shortly after making the change public, the mythical Tom took it "offline for a bit to fine tune it." The announcement said that it would be back online in a few hours.
