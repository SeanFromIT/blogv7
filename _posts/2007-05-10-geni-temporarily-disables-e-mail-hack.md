Many [Geni](http://www.geni.com/) users have come to enjoy the node linking offered by the e-mail hack where you use a fake email without an invite to connect various family members.  
  
Geni [announced](http://forum.geni.com/topic.php?id=423&page&replies=2) this week that the hack was creating cycling issues (the 'Undefined Tree' error) so they have temporarily disabled the hack. They say it should be fixed and enabled again in a few weeks.
