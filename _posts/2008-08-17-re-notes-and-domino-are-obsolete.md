<blockquote>"In my view, the underlying economic model upon which distributed client/server systems were based back in the 1980s and 1990s is dead." --[Ron Herardian](http://www.dominopower.com/issues/issue200808/00002220001.html)</blockquote>

  
I disagree with his generalization here, but I 100% agree that Lotus Notes and its Domino Server technology is dead in 2008. It simply couldn't keep up with the times. The only companies still running it do so because they don't want to admit defeat and transition from their custom-written Domino database applications to something sustainable and accessible. That requires investment, and we're in a recession, remember?
