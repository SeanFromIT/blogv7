Google is now directly competing with people search niche sites like [Spock](http://www.spock.com/), [Wink](http://wink.com/), and [PeekYou](http://www.peekyou.com/) by offering you control of your online "profile." Instead of linking it to their social network Orkut, they're taking the same approach as the existing people search sites by linking results to existing (third-party) social networking sites. It will be interesting to see how the existing people search sites will react to Google's actions...will they continue to survive?
