**Disclaimer:** This is a blog. Blog is short for weblog, but it’s really just another backwards chronologically ordered means of publishing. As such, if you come across a post that doesn’t make sense, try looking for a newer post in that category. Information may not be or remain valid for very long, and it might not have been accurate to begin with. I cannot be held responsible for the content of external links, and I do not necessarily endorse them or everything about them. Content of each post is my opinion and is not intended to malign any religion, club, organization, company, or individual. If you don’t like my opinion, tough; post a comment with your differing viewpoint and turn it into a discussion, not litigation. Any persons claiming libel or defamation should leave this site immediately or at least close your eyes, lest your narrow mindedness be challenged. My intention is not to defame or libel you or your organization; I only make my personal opinions about your bad practices known. All posts are the responsibility of me alone and do not necessarily represent the views of my employers. Feel free to challenge me, disagree with me, or tell me that I’m completely nuts in the comments section of each blog entry, but under current US laws I will not and cannot be held responsible for comments posted to this site. I reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason whatsoever (abusive, profane, or rude) so keep it polite and intelligent, please. If you use any advice, tips, techniques, recommendations, file downloads or software hacks from this site and you or your system(s) are injured, I am not responsible. Thanks to the possibility of human error, nothing should be taken as fact unless explicitly stated as such. I am also not responsible for mistranslation or misinterpretation of content. If something doesn’t jive, post your question in a comment. All content licensed under [creative commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) except where explicitly stated. All damages are limited to my $0.02 if you continue to be a moron and try and sue me. You are responsible for any court costs, since you’re the one asking me to come defend myself in court. Any court action must occur in my home jurisdiction, not yours. Your use of this site implies your acceptance of these terms. If you disagree with any statement in this disclaimer, you must leave this site immediately, forget everything you’ve seen, and never return.
