MUL has a [nice article](http://www.myuninstalledlife.com/managing-bookmarks-online-part2) listing some programs that can check bookmark links in IE, Opera, Firefox and Netscape as well as one that can online bookmark sites like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) and [blogmarks](http://blogmarks.net/).
