<blockquote>Gary Mckinnon, who faces extradition to the US for allegedly hacking into military computers, has been offered asylum by the self-styled breakaway state of Sealand, it was claimed at the Infosec security conference today. The "state", a World War II fort known as Roughs Tower in the North Sea just north of the Thames, was declared an independent principality in 1967 by a former major called Paddy Roy Bates. He dubbed himself Prince Roy. Mckinnon sat on a hackers panel at Infosec to debate new changes to the Computer Misuse Act. The claim about Sealand was made by one of his fellow panelists, a "security analyst" identified only as Mark.</blockquote>
