If you receive a message about your Note II device not being supported after you update the Facebook app, it's because you don't also have Facebook Messenger installed. So to be clear, to run Facebook Home, you need the following apps from the Google Play store (only available in the United States as of today):  
  


  1. [Facebook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&feature=nav_result)
  2. [Facebook Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&feature=nav_other)
  3. [Facebook Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.home&feature=search_result)
