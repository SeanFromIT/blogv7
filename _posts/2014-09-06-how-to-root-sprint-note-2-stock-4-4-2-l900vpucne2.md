This post assumes you've rooted before and know about using [Odin](https://mega.co.nz/#!3R5GVTob!GXkGcH4ZPkUANKyX3gxupjMxqpg5DIM9GimxMqhHJ4U) and have the [Windows Samsung USB drivers](https://mega.co.nz/#!yVJnlCAL!W2TKtTloGVWQtFD0AON1DG1pgPJCEqAVxonqlSPeqOg) installed.

  1. Boot to Download (ODIN) Mode by holding VOL DOWN+HOME+POWER. Install the latest [Philz Touch CWM](http://click.xda-developers.com/api/click?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_jsonp_141004378252510&key=f0a7f91912ae2b52e0700f73990eb321&libId=fe6d5f93-1501-476c-aa9e-9f8b3d2933fb&loc=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.xda-developers.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D2653671%26page%3D54&v=1&out=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.im%2Fdevs%2Fphilz_touch%2FCWM_Advanced_Edition%2Fl900&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&title=Note%20II%20-%20the%204.4.2%20update%20-%20discussion%20thre%E2%80%A6%20-%20Pg.%2054%20%7C%20Sprint%20Galaxy%20Note%20II%20%7C%20XDA%20Forums&txt=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.im%2Fdevs%2Fphilz_touch%2FCWM_A...d_Edition%2Fl900) (choose .tar.md5 version) via Odin PDA option. You may need to unplug your battery to get Windows and ODIN to recognize the device.
  2. Boot to Recovery Mode by holding VOL UP+HOME+POWER. Install ZIP of [SuperSU](http://click.xda-developers.com/api/click?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_jsonp_141004400230312&key=f0a7f91912ae2b52e0700f73990eb321&libId=fe6d5f93-1501-476c-aa9e-9f8b3d2933fb&loc=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.xda-developers.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D2653671%26page%3D54&v=1&out=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.chainfire.eu%2F446%2FSuperSU%2FUPDATE-SuperSU-v1.99r3.zip&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&title=Note%20II%20-%20the%204.4.2%20update%20-%20discussion%20thre%E2%80%A6%20-%20Pg.%2054%20%7C%20Sprint%20Galaxy%20Note%20II%20%7C%20XDA%20Forums&txt=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.chainfire.eu%2F446%2FSup...SU-v1.99r3.zip). Reboot phone. Update SuperSU if needed, test if it worked by opening it. It will prompt you to disable KNOX, go ahead and let it. It was successful for me.

via [XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2653671&page=54) and [Androidayos](http://www.androidayos.com/2014/06/06/root-l900vpucne2-4-4-2-kitkat-galaxy-note-2-l900-sprint-update/). As always, you follow any of my advice at your own risk! Not responsible for bricked phones etc.

  


If above doesn't work for you, you can try [L900 CF-Auto Root](http://download.chainfire.eu/270/CF-Root/CF-Auto-Root/CF-Auto-Root-t0ltespr-t0ltespr-sphl900.zip) (flashed via ODIN PDA) as well. I did this prior to the above but it was unsuccessful on its own.
