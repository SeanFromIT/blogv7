It's almost like when one goes down, they all go down. Tonight [Fuser](http://www.fuser.com/) is sporting a HTTP Error 503 Service Unavailable error while [TweetMyJobs](http://www.tweetmyjobs.com/)'s job posting links are not working. No custom error pages here...the TweetMyJobs site even says "If you're the administrator of this website, then please read the log file "production.log" to find out what went wrong."
