So there is a [support article](https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204075496-How-to-Resolve-Errors-in-the-Social-Club-Launcher-for-GTAV-PC) with some ideas. They didn't work for me. But note the [Social Club install file](https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/articles/200146066) linked there.

For me I had a bad "Rockstar Games" folder/link in My Documents. So the fix is:



	
  1. Uninstall Rockstar Social Club from Windows Add/Remove Programs.

	
  2. Delete the bad "Rockstar Games" folder in My Documents.

	
  3. Install Rockstar Social Club manually using the link above.

	
  4. Launch from Steam successfully.
