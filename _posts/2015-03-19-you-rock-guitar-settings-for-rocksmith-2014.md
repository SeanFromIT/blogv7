Here are my settings for the YRG-1000 Gen 1 MIDI guitar controller.

1) Use the Rocksmith cable
2) Press the GUITAR and SLIDE buttons
3) Preset 1 generally works. If you're having trouble, change to a "clean" sound by holding GUITAR, scrolling to 3 and releasing GUITAR.

**Hints:**



	
  1. The thin metal bar, beneath tail piece, closest to whammy bar is the mute bar (since this is a MIDI guitar you can't hold strings to mute). This will help you get through the calibration setup quicker.

	
  2. You can't palm mute, bend or accent since this is a MIDI guitar. It doesn't have 'real' strings and the game doesn't accept a whammy as a bend.

	
  3. Check battery level by holding MUSIC for two seconds. The orange lights below the preset # will indicate level.

	
  4. If any of the the strings aren't triggering quite right when strummed, you can adjust sensitivity using a Phillips screwdriver on the screws at the base of the bridge. Be careful not to over-tighten.

	
  5. Do not try and play with the guitar's USB plugged into the same computer/console. There will be interference and you will have to restart the game to get the tuning to work right again.


**[Song-specific tuning](http://www.theriffrepeater.com/rocksmith-2014-setlist/rocksmith-2014-tunings/):**
Hold OPEN until the number blinks, scroll to the new tuning and release the OPEN button.



	
  1. E Standard: 0 or 1
_Most songs_

	
  2. Slightly sharp/flat (A446): This doesn't seem possible at this time.
_The Kinks - You Really Got Me_

	
  3. Drop D: 7
_A7X - Bat Country_

	
  4. Eb Drop Db: This doesn't seem possible at this time.
_Deftones - My Own Summer (Shove It)_
