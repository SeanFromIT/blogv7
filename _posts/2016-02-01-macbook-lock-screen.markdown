They seem to change this every time a new model comes out. This works as of today:



	
  1. Launch the “Keychain Access” application located in /Applications/Utilities.

	
  2. In the top bar, choose Keychain Access drop down and select Preferences.

	
  3. Check "Show keychain status in menu bar."


You can now use the lock icon next to your clock to Lock Screen. This will not kill active network connections like Sleep does.
