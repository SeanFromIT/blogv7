While social networking can touch every industry, some industries stand to gain more than others. Please comment with your ideas - I'll list a few of my thoughts below:  
  


  * Information Technology, Internet, and all computer-related fields for obvious reasons
  * Political officers and organizations since they need the will of the people to hold power
  * Non-profits who need donations from several small donors to stay alive
  * Real Estate, because its all about the individual "realtors" - the bigger the ego, the more sales they make.
  * Entertainment - you need people to know about you to turn a profit.
