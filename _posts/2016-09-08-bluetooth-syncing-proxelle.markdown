proxelle is a bluetooth to 3.5mm mini adapter useful for bringing older or limited-capability audio devices into the 21st century. To pair it with your phone:



	
  1. Start with proxelle off.

	
  2. Hold the button for 4 seconds and the indicator light will flash red and blue. This is roughly two seconds beyond simply turning it on.

	
  3. Scan for the device "Engage" on your phone and pair it (if asked, PIN is 0000).

	
  4. When successful, the indicator light will flash blue twice every 5 seconds. The device remains on and you can use it immediately.

	
  5. To turn proxelle off, hold but button for 4 seconds and the indicator light will flash red three times.
