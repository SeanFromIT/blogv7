[Instructions to root the original Evo 4G](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=787304)  
[Updated instructions for HBOOT 2.17+](http://therootofallevo.com/2012/02/htc-evo-4g-root-hboot-2-18-0001-gain-s-off/)  
  
I may occasionally update this with more essential apps:  


  * [Android Wifi Tether](http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/downloads/list) - Sprint will try to charge you to use the 4G hotspot found via settings; this will turn your phone into a hotspot for free.
  * [BusyBox](http://market.android.com/details?id=com.jrummy.busybox.installer) - JRummy16's BusyBox Installer includes essential unix apps like cp, grep. I chose 1.19 and /system/bin. You can uninstall this installer after running it and busybox will stay. This version is better than Stericson's because it symlinks some additional things (like which) that Stericson's doesn't.
  * ASTRO - GUI file browser
  * ConnectBot - Extra ssh client features when rooted
  * Titanium Backup - Backup and delete stock apps
  * [Terminal Emulator](http://market.android.com/details?id=jackpal.androidterm) - Jack Palevich's "Android Terminal Emulator" works best with the Evo's touch screen.
