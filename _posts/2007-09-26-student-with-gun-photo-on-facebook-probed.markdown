Talk about invasion of privacy. The sad part is that it is the woman's own friends who turned her in. Moral of the story: choose your Facebook friends wisely.  
  


<blockquote>OKLAHOMA CITY -- A University of Oklahoma student posted a picture of herself with what police said is a pellet gun on her Facebook page, KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City reported.  
  
The picture was deemed serious enough to launch an investigation, police said.  
  
The student, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she is frustrated because she feels this thing has been "overblown."</blockquote>
