Last year, you may remember the [TF2 exploit]({{ site.baseurl }}/team-fortress-2-exploit-exposes-steam-account-password.html) that allowed unauthorized users to take control of your Steam account. Well the hackers are at it again, this time using Valve's runaway hit Left 4 Dead. I would encourage anyone with information on the exploit to post it - let's hope Valve gets around to fixing it sometime soon.

Update 5/31/18: [Valve finally patched the exploit](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9k8qv5/steam-exploit-left-users-vulnerable-for-10-years)!
