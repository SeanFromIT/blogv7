I was delighted to see that people are finally starting to stand up to domain squatters by recommending the 1999 Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) be strengthened. It's a nasty practice that prevents sites with good intentions from getting a well placed domain name because of do-nothing ad-infested sites squatting most mainstream domain names.  
  
There's also an introduction to "domain tasting", a new practice where you can get access to an unregistered domain name for a limited time period and not have to pay anything if you give it back. This loophole allows squatters to test - or taste - the profitability of placing ads on that site. Go Daddy termed it "kiting."
